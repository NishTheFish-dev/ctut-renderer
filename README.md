# C Tutorial Renderer

I made this quick project to improve my C coding skills and concepts. I also wanted to learn optimization so the rendering is done entirely by the CPU :)

## Dependencies

`clang`/`gcc`, `make`, `SDL2`

### Install on Linux

**Ubuntu/Debian**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install clang make libsdl2-dev
```

**Fedora**
```bash
sudo dnf install clang make SDL2-devel
```

**Arch Linux**
```bash
sudo pacman -S clang make sdl2
```

## Instructions for Testing

- `cd` into the project folder
- run `make`
- run the renderer like this: `./renderer`
